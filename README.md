# menuphi
Menuphi is an app designed to help restaurant owners and managers reduce costs and boost profits through menu engineering and analysis. It simplifies the process of menu analysis by providing a template for users to fill out with their menu item data. Once the template is filled out and uploaded to Menuphi, users receive a comprehensive analysis and recommendations based on each menu item's profitability and popularity. This allows restaurant owners to make informed decisions about their menu offerings and optimize their overall profitability.
