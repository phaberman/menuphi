# Menuphi
Menuphi is an app designed to help restaurant owners and managers reduce costs and boost profits through menu engineering and analysis. It simplifies the process of menu analysis by providing a template for users to fill out with their menu item data. Once the template is filled out and uploaded to Menuphi, users receive a comprehensive analysis and recommendations based on each menu item's profitability and popularity. This allows restaurant owners to make informed decisions about their menu offerings and optimize their overall profitability.

## Key Features
- Easy-to-use template: Menuphi provides a user-friendly template that restaurant owners can download and fill out with their menu item data. This template captures essential information about each menu item, such as its cost, price, and other relevant metrics.

- Comprehensive analysis: Once the filled-out template is uploaded to Menuphi, the app performs a thorough analysis of the menu items. It calculates the profitability of each item, taking into account factors such as item costs and price.

- Recommendations: Based on the analysis, Menuphi generates tailored recommendations for optimizing the menu. It suggests what actions users should take regarding each menu item. These recommendations are aimed at maximizing profits while maintaining customer satisfaction.

- Time-saving: By automating the menu analysis process, Menuphi saves restaurant owners valuable time that would otherwise be spent manually crunching numbers and analyzing data. This allows them to focus more on running their restaurant, enhancing customer experience, and making strategic decisions.
